Pronouns: He/His

I'm a programmer and a current developer @ OlivMC.
I also enjoy doing things on my own.

I'm currently working on RWCMP (remote windows computer managment protocol), a way to remotley manage Windows machines.

I'm learning x86 Assembly - a great language to understand how computers work.

You can find me at coredoescode@gmail.com or my website, coresdev.ml.

Fun fact: I love minecraft!
